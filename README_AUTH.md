# Studio Code - Authentication Implementation

## Overview
Complete authentication system with email/password and Google OAuth support for Studio Code's multi-dashboard platform.

## What's Working Now

### 1. Landing Page Authentication
- Login/Signup modal integrated throughout the landing page
- Accessible via buttons: "Join Network", "Client Area", "Start a Project", etc.
- Two authentication methods:
  - Email & Password (works immediately)
  - Google OAuth (requires one-time Supabase configuration)

### 2. Protected Dashboards
All four dashboards are fully protected and role-aware:
- `client_dashboard.html` - Default dashboard for new signups
- `developer_dashboard.html` - For verified developers
- `sales_dashboard.html` - For commissioners/sales team
- `admin_dashboard.html` - For administrators

### 3. Automatic Role-Based Routing
Users are automatically redirected to their appropriate dashboard:
- Client role → Client Dashboard
- Developer role → Developer Dashboard
- Commissioner role → Sales Dashboard
- Admin role → Admin Dashboard

### 4. Database Schema
Created `profiles` table with:
- User information (email, first_name, last_name)
- Role-based access control
- Automatic profile creation on signup
- Row Level Security (RLS) enabled

## Google OAuth Setup (One-Time Configuration)

### You Have:
- Client ID: `392087578204-kc67bu47i37954f8vttl0srp25nrf692.apps.googleusercontent.com`
- Client Secret: `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`

### To Activate:
1. Open your Supabase project dashboard
2. Go to **Authentication** → **Providers**
3. Find **Google** and toggle it ON
4. Paste the Client ID and Client Secret
5. Click **Save**
6. In Google Cloud Console, add this redirect URI:
   ```
   https://smdbfaomeghoejqqkplv.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback
   ```

**Detailed instructions**: See `GOOGLE_OAUTH_SETUP.md`

## Testing Your Implementation

### Immediate Testing (Email/Password)
1. Open `landing_page.html`
2. Click "Join Network"
3. Fill in signup form
4. Submit → Automatically redirected to client dashboard

### Test Google OAuth (After Configuration)
1. Click "Client Area"
2. Click "Continue with Google"
3. Sign in with Google account
4. Automatically redirected to client dashboard

**Full testing guide**: See `TESTING_GUIDE.md`

## Managing User Roles

All new signups default to 'client' role. To change roles:

```sql
-- View all users
SELECT email, role FROM public.profiles;

-- Promote user to admin
UPDATE public.profiles
SET role = 'admin'
WHERE email = 'user@example.com';

-- Make user a developer
UPDATE public.profiles
SET role = 'developer'
WHERE email = 'developer@example.com';

-- Make user a commissioner (sales)
UPDATE public.profiles
SET role = 'commissioner'
WHERE email = 'sales@example.com';
```

After updating role, user must sign out and sign back in to be redirected to the correct dashboard.

## How Authentication Works

### Sign Up Flow
1. User clicks any auth trigger button on landing page
2. Modal opens with signup form
3. User enters details or clicks "Continue with Google"
4. Profile automatically created with role='client'
5. User redirected to `client_dashboard.html`

### Sign In Flow
1. User clicks login button
2. Modal opens with login form
3. User authenticates (email/password or Google)
4. System checks user role in database
5. User redirected to role-specific dashboard

### Dashboard Protection
Each dashboard verifies on load:
- Is user authenticated? (If no → redirect to landing)
- Does user have permission? (If no → redirect to correct dashboard)
- Session valid? (If no → redirect to landing)

### Sign Out
All dashboards have sign-out functionality that:
- Clears Supabase session
- Redirects to landing page
- Requires re-authentication to access dashboards

## Security Features

- Row Level Security (RLS) enabled on profiles table
- Users can only read/update their own profile
- Roles can only be changed by database admins
- Password strength validation on signup
- Secure session management via Supabase
- HTTPS enforced in production

## Files Structure

### Core Files
- `landing_page.html` - Main landing page with integrated auth modal
- `supabase-client.js` - Authentication client and helper functions
- `client_dashboard.html` - Default dashboard
- `developer_dashboard.html` - Developer dashboard
- `sales_dashboard.html` - Commissioner/sales dashboard
- `admin_dashboard.html` - Admin dashboard

### Documentation
- `README_AUTH.md` - This file (overview)
- `AUTH_SETUP_COMPLETE.md` - Detailed implementation summary
- `GOOGLE_OAUTH_SETUP.md` - Step-by-step Google OAuth setup
- `TESTING_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive testing instructions

### Utilities
- `seed_logins.js` - Script to create test users (optional)

## No UI/UX Changes
All existing designs preserved:
- Landing page layout unchanged
- Dashboard designs unchanged
- Color schemes maintained
- Animations and interactions intact

Only authentication functionality added.

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Invalid login credentials"**
- Verify email/password are correct
- Passwords are case-sensitive

**Google OAuth not working**
- Ensure provider is enabled in Supabase dashboard
- Verify credentials are correctly entered
- Check redirect URI in Google Console

**Wrong dashboard after login**
- Check user role in database
- Sign out and sign back in after role change

**Can't access dashboard**
- Verify you're logged in
- Check browser console for errors
- Clear browser cache and cookies

### Getting Help
1. Check browser console (F12) for error messages
2. Review `TESTING_GUIDE.md` for troubleshooting steps
3. Verify database migration applied successfully
4. Check Supabase dashboard for authentication logs

## Database Migration

Migration file: `create_profiles_and_auth`

**Status**: ✅ Applied successfully

Includes:
- `profiles` table creation
- RLS policies
- Automatic profile creation trigger
- Role update trigger
- Indexes for performance

## Next Steps

1. **Test email/password authentication** (works immediately)
2. **Configure Google OAuth** in Supabase dashboard (5 minutes)
3. **Test Google OAuth** authentication
4. **Create test users** with different roles
5. **Verify role-based routing** works correctly

## Production Checklist

Before deploying to production:
- [ ] Google OAuth configured in Supabase
- [ ] Redirect URIs configured in Google Console
- [ ] Test all authentication flows
- [ ] Test all dashboard redirects
- [ ] Verify RLS policies working
- [ ] Test sign out functionality
- [ ] Check session persistence
- [ ] Verify error handling
- [ ] Test on multiple browsers
- [ ] Test on mobile devices

## Quick Reference

### Authentication Functions (Global)
```javascript
// Check if user is logged in and redirect to dashboard
redirectIfLoggedIn()

// Protect a dashboard (redirect if not authorized)
protectDashboard()

// Initiate Google OAuth flow
initiateGoogleAuth()

// Sign out current user
signOut()

// Show toast notification
showToast('Message here')
```

### Database Queries
```sql
-- View all users

-- Update user role
UPDATE public.profiles SET role = 'admin' WHERE email = 'user@example.com';

-- Count users by role
SELECT role, COUNT(*) FROM public.profiles GROUP BY role;
```
