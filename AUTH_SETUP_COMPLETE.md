# Authentication Setup - Complete ✓

## What's Been Implemented

### 1. Database Schema
- Created `profiles` table with role-based access control
- Roles: `client`, `developer`, `commissioner`, `admin`
- Automatic profile creation on user signup
- Row Level Security (RLS) enabled

### 2. Authentication Methods
- **Email/Password**: Traditional signup and login
- **Google OAuth**: One-click sign-in with Google accounts

### 3. Landing Page Integration
- Sign Up / Login modal accessible from multiple CTAs throughout the page
- Modal includes:
  - Tab switching between Sign In and Sign Up
  - Email/password forms
  - Google OAuth button
  - Password strength indicator
  - Form validation

### 4. Dashboard Protection
All dashboards are protected and redirect users based on authentication state:
- **Unauthenticated users** → Redirected to landing page
- **Authenticated users** → Redirected to role-specific dashboard
  - `client` → `client_dashboard.html`
  - `developer` → `developer_dashboard.html`
  - `commissioner` → `sales_dashboard.html`
  - `admin` → `admin_dashboard.html`

### 5. Automatic Redirects
- Users are automatically redirected after successful login/signup
- Dashboard pages verify user permissions on load
- Users trying to access unauthorized dashboards are redirected to their correct dashboard

## Google OAuth Configuration

### Credentials Provided
- **Client ID**: `392087578204-kc67bu47i37954f8vttl0srp25nrf692.apps.googleusercontent.com`
- **Client Secret**: `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`

### To Activate (Required)
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Providers
2. Enable Google provider
3. Enter the Client ID and Client Secret
4. In Google Cloud Console, add this redirect URI:
   ```
   https://smdbfaomeghoejqqkplv.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback
   ```

See `GOOGLE_OAUTH_SETUP.md` for detailed instructions.

## How It Works

### User Flow - Sign Up
1. User clicks any "Join Network" or "Start a Project" button
2. Auth modal opens (defaults to Sign Up tab)
3. User can:
   - Fill in first name, last name, email, password → Submit
   - OR click "Continue with Google"
4. Profile is automatically created with role='client'
5. User is redirected to `client_dashboard.html`

### User Flow - Login
1. User clicks "Client Area" or "Sign In" button
2. Auth modal opens (defaults to Sign In tab)
3. User can:
   - Enter email and password → Submit
   - OR click "Continue with Google"
4. User is redirected to their role-specific dashboard

### Dashboard Protection
Each dashboard has:
```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@supabase/supabase-js@2"></script>
<script src="supabase-client.js"></script>
<script>
  if (window.protectDashboard) protectDashboard();
</script>
```

This ensures:
- Only authenticated users can access dashboards
- Users are on the correct dashboard for their role
- Automatic redirect if permissions don't match

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files
- `GOOGLE_OAUTH_SETUP.md` - Detailed Google OAuth setup guide
- `AUTH_SETUP_COMPLETE.md` - This file

### Modified Files
- `supabase-client.js` - Enhanced Google OAuth with better error handling
- `package.json` - Added build script

### Database Migration
- Migration: `create_profiles_and_auth`
- Creates `profiles` table
- Sets up RLS policies
- Creates triggers for automatic profile creation

## Testing

### Option 1: Email/Password
1. Open landing page
2. Click "Join Network" or "Client Area"
3. Sign up with email and password
4. Should redirect to client dashboard

### Option 2: Google OAuth (after configuration)
1. Open landing page
2. Click "Join Network" or "Client Area"
3. Click "Continue with Google"
4. Sign in with Google account
5. Should redirect to client dashboard

### Test Different Roles
After signup, update user role in database:
```sql
-- View all users
SELECT id, email, role FROM public.profiles;

-- Change role
UPDATE public.profiles
SET role = 'admin'
WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';
```

Log out and log back in to see the new dashboard.

## Sign Out Functionality
All dashboards have sign-out functionality via the `signOut()` global function:
- Logs out from Supabase
- Redirects to landing page
- Clears all session data

## Security Features
- Row Level Security (RLS) enabled
- Users can only read/update their own profiles
- Roles can only be changed by database administrators
- Password strength indicator on signup
- HTTPS required for production (Supabase handles this)

## UI/UX - No Changes
All existing UI/UX has been preserved:
- Landing page design unchanged
- Dashboard layouts unchanged
- Color schemes unchanged
- Animations and interactions unchanged

Only authentication functionality has been added without altering the existing design.
